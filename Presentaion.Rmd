This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Total_data <- read.csv("../Cmda Capstone/presentation_data.csv")
flipped <- t(Total_data)
library(plotrix)
lbls <- c("Ocean Waste", "Landfill", "Fuel useage", "Recycled")
jpeg(file="PieChart.jpeg")
pie(flipped, labels=NA,col=brewer.pal(4,"Set1"), main="United States Plastic Disposal",border="white", cex=0.8)
legend("bottomright", legend = lbls, bty = "n",fill=brewer.pal(4,"Set1"))
dev.off()
```

```{r}
sum(Total_data)/2000
Total_data$ocean/sum(Total_data)
Total_data$ocean/2000
Total_data$landfill/2000
Total_data$landfill/sum(Total_data)
Total_data$conbustion_energy/2000
Total_data$conbustion_energy/sum(Total_data)
Total_data$total_recycled_amount/2000
Total_data$total_recycled_amount/sum(Total_data)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

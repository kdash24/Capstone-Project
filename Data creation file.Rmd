Reading in csv with the population below

```{r}
Census_data <- read.csv("../Cmda Capstone/Census Population.csv")
```

Next I will create two arrays one with the list of states names and one with the population values
```{r}
States <- Census_data$Ã¯..table.with.row.headers.in.column.A.and.column.headers.in.rows.3.through.4...leading.dots.indicate.sub.parts.
States <- as.character((States))
States <- States[-52:-58]
Pop_2018 <- Census_data$X.10
Pop_2018 <- gsub(",", "", Pop_2018)
Pop_2018 <- as.integer(Pop_2018)
Pop_2018 <- Pop_2018[-1:-8]
Pop_2018 <- Pop_2018[-52:-58]
DC_pop <- Pop_2018[9]
```

Next I need to remove the District of Columbia label then add their population to Virginia

```{r}
States <- States[-9]
States
DC_pop
Pop_2018 <- Pop_2018[-9]
#Pop_2018[47] <- Pop_2018[47] + DC_pop
```

```{r}
